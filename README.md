# Teach yourself C in 24 Hours
## A book by [Tony Zhang](http://aelinik.free.fr/c/)

### Neither this book is strictly written for a 24 hour non-stop workout, nor I aim to achieve it in 24 hours.

But surely, the exercises in the book makes me think and claim, 

> ___I now know C!___

I am religiously doing as many exercises as I could, and I plan to get back to the renowned [K&R](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/210606/is-there-an-advantage-for-a-c-programmer-to-have-read-kr) and [Learn C the Hard Way](), maybe not in the same order, though.
